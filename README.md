1. Set up a React project using `create-react-app`.
2. Create a Redux store with a reducer to manage the application state.
3. Fetch data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) using Redux actions.
4. Display the fetched data in a component as a list.

#### Task 2: Mapbox GL

Integrate Mapbox GL into your React application.

1. Get a free Mapbox API key.
2. Display a Mapbox map in a separate React component.
3. Add a marker to the map at a specific location.

2. Implement responsive design for your application.

#### Task 4: Algorithm

Implement a function in JavaScript that checks if a given word is a palindrome.

```javascript
function isPalindrome(word) {
  // Your code here
}

// Example usage:
console.log(isPalindrome("level")); // Should return true
console.log(isPalindrome("hello")); // Should return false
```
